  Run quality assurance checks on the sonar CLI binary. Use this skill when the

  "run quality assurance", "check the CLI", or wants to validate that sonar is
  working correctly after a build.

# Sonar QA Skill

Run the sonar QA test suite by executing the reusable `scripts/qa.sh` script.
This script builds sonar, runs all functional checks across every command and
flag, validates output, exit codes, error handling, and JSON contracts, then
prints a structured pass/fail report.

ARGUMENTS: optional path to the sonar binary. If not provided, the script
builds from source automatically.

## Workflow

### 1. Run the QA script

```bash
./scripts/qa.sh [optional-binary-path]
```

The script handles everything:
- Builds sonar (if no binary path given)
- Creates isolated temp directories so tests don't affect user state
- Runs all test sections in order (A through S)
- Cleans up temp directories on exit
- Prints a full pass/fail report with details on failures
- Exits 0 if all checks pass, 1 if any fail

### 2. Review the output

The script prints a summary table and final result line:

```
QA Result: X/Y checks passed
```

If any checks failed, they are listed at the bottom for visibility.

### 3. Report results to the user

Summarize the QA results. If there are failures, investigate and fix them.

## Test Coverage

The script covers these sections (see `scripts/qa.sh` for full details):

| Section | Description | Checks |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| A | No-DB commands (version, help, config) | 5 |
| B | Init lifecycle | 4 |
| C | Config after init | 2 |
| D | SONAR_PATH override | 3 |
| E | Quiet mode | 2 |
| F | Create command | 11 |
| G | List command (filters, sorting, tree) | 12 |
| H | Show command | 6 |
| I | Move command (status transitions) | 11 |
| J | Close command | 6 |
| K | Reopen command | 6 |
| L | Edit command (all flags) | 15 |
| M | Edit reparenting (cycles, self-ref) | 11 |
| N | Delete — simple | 5 |
| O | Delete — cascade and orphan | 16 |
| P | Activity log verification | 6 |
| Q | JSON contract validation | 11 |
| R | Exit codes (all commands) | 23 |
| S | Error paths (no DB) | 10 |

## Developer Usage

Developers can run the script directly without Claude:

```bash
# Build and test
./scripts/qa.sh

# Test a specific binary
./scripts/qa.sh /path/to/sonar
```

Requires `jq` to be installed for JSON validation.
